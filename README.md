# science-festival
Materials for an "Open Science is Better Science" themed science festival activity. 

Includes Open Science posters and an activity: "Whodunit"-style crime-solving activity (who stole the passion fruit?) to promote actively sharing science (it's easier to solve the crime the more you know!)
